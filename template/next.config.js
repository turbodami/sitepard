const path = require("path");

      // Note: for some reason this doesn't work unless it points directly to the "lib" directory - i.e. pointing to the root folder causes Babel to fail with syntax error on the "export" statement. Wtf?
      // Same happens if in package.json I declare the dependency to nextpress as file:../ (local dependency)...
      "next-express": path.resolve(__dirname, "..", "..", "lib"),
